# codmetric_Maze-Game-Solver

Developed as part of my internship at **Codmetric (May–June 2025)**, this project is a GUI-based **Maze Game Solver** built using **Python** and **Tkinter**, with an auto-solve feature powered by the **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithm. The game involves collecting a key and reaching the goal while navigating through obstacles.

# Maze Game Solver 🧩

This is an interactive maze puzzle game created during my internship at Codmetric. It offers both manual and AI-assisted solving, making it fun as well as educational. The player must first collect a key before reaching the goal. The BFS algorithm is used to automatically find the shortest path through the maze.
